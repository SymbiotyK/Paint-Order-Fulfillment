The analysis panels were developed for the program's flexibility and accessibility by technologists, which is impossible for operators. Data from the database is retrieved using Power Query and tailored to the needs of analysis.

Two panels have been created: for analyzing production downtimes and for analyzing defects (Pareto chart). Both panels are fully interactive and display data from the database. After selecting the week, day, and shift, charts corresponding to specific input data are presented, ready for printing or further analysis.
