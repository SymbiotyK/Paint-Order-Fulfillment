Sanding panel contains:  
1. Top navbar (current shift, current data, shearch bar, refresh button)
2. Main table with last 100 orders
3. Edit selected order option
4. Generate sanding rapot button

The purpose of this panel is to review NOK (Not OK) pieces that have been entered into the database during unloading and assign them a specific tag. This is because the piece is completely disassembled for the sandblasting process, and the label with the serial code of the block is scraped off. By attaching a screw with a tag and entering it into the system, we can later identify the piece.

To edit a specific record, we need to click on it, which will display the screen for editing that order. However, the only thing that can be entered is the sandblasting date, which fills in automatically (current), and the number of the mentioned tag.

After the sandblasting process, the operator needs to generate a report of the pieces they sandblasted and then print it out, leaving it on the pallet with the pieces for quicker identification.
