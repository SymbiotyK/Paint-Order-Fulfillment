Unloading panel contains:
1. Top navbar (current shift, current data, todays output, refresh button)
2. Main table with last 100 Not OK items
3. Add new NOK button
4. Edit selected NOK button
5. Delete selected NOK button

The purpose of this panel is to track all NOK (Not OK) pieces coming out of the paint shop, which may have leaks from the nozzles or drips from the adapter. Such pieces need to be set aside and subjected to the sandblasting process followed by repainting.

The operating scheme of the panel is very similar to that of the [loading panel](https://github.com/SymbiotyK/Paint-Order-Fulfillment/blob/main/LoadingPanel.md), but here we are dealing with defects (individual pieces) rather than entire orders.
